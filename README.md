# LinkiePin

So I built a LinkedIn clone because the real site is... a lot. I wanted to make something that looks clean and handles responsive layouts well, without relying on big frameworks. Just pure HTML & CSS.

## The Idea
The goal was simple: recreate the core experience of a professional network but keep the code lightweight. No React, no build tools, just files you can open in a browser.

## What's Inside?
- **Login Page:** Kept it super minimal. Clean inputs, centered box, nice logo.
- **Profile Page:** This was the fun part. Built a full profile header with a banner, profile pic, and action buttons.
- **The Feed (sort of):** Well, it's static for now, but the structure is there.
- **Responsive:** The sidebar magically turns into a hamburger menu on mobile. Spent way too long getting flexbox to behave perfectly on small screens.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML5:** Tried to keep the markup meaningful.
- **CSS Variables:** For consistent colors (that green!).
- **Mobile First:** Looks good on your phone too.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Literally 0 npm installs required.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Done.
